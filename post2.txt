TITLE: Watch Out for Holes!


CONTENT:
Here at Run Dog Run, we take safety seriously.

When you're out running with your dog (or you're standing around and your dog is running), make sure to keep an eye out for holes, branches, or other obstacles that your furry friend could get tangled up on. The most dangerous time is when the dog is distracted by a ball or toy, and is paying less attention to their footing.

If you notice your dog limping or slowing down quicker than usual, stop activity at once and check out his legs and paws. Look for debris or sharp objects in the paw pads, and if any pressure on the legs causes pain. If so, call the vet!
