TITLE: Take Your Own Dog to the River


CONTENT:
Even though we love exercising your pet for you, your dog-person relationship will benefit from you spending time with your furry friend as well! Got a weekend free? Take Fido to the river!

If itâ€™s sunny out, try to go later in the day to avoid most of the kids and sunbathers.
